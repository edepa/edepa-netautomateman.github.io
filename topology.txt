Components: 
	1:OpenFlow switches
		Qty:6
	2:OpenFlow Controller
		Qty:1
Topology:
	1:Description
		1:The topology is organised into a hierarchy comprising a provider edge and a provider core.
		2:There are 4 core switches.
		3:There are 2 edge switches.
		4:The core switches are interconnected in a full mesh.
		5:The edge switches are connected to two core routers (each). This is for redundancy.

Architecture
	1:Description
		1:This is a provider's network that is composed entirely of OpenFlow-compliant devices.
		2:The switches are data plane devices. They perform forwarding based upon the content of their flow tables.
